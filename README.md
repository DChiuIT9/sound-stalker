TASTE TREE
"Branch Out"

Utilizing the Taste Dive API, users will be able to search for musical artists/bands they like, and return similar artists back.  From there, we will utilize YouTube and Ticketmaster's APIs to present the user with a popular video and any upcoming events related to these arists.  We aim to allow the user to select one of the related artists to run the process all over again, which would have the user branching out more and more.
